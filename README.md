# BizCardX: Extracting Business Card Data with OCR

#Introduction:

The objective of this project is to develop a Streamlit application that enables users to upload a business card image and extract essential information from it using easyOCR. The extracted information includes the company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin code. The extracted details will be displayed in a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).

# Tools:

Python

Streamlit

easyOCR

Postgres

# Procedure:

Install the necessary tools and libraries, including Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and the chosen database management system.

Plan the structure of the application, including modules, functions, and the user interface layout.

Create a Streamlit application file: Start by importing the required libraries and defining the necessary functions and components.

Use Streamlit to design a simple and intuitive user interface that guides users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting the information. Display the extracted details in a clean and organized manner.

Utilize the easyOCR library to extract text from the uploaded business card image. Process the image and extract the relevant information fields such as the company name, card holder name, etc.

Establish a connection to the chosen database management system (Postgres). Set up the necessary tables or collections to store the extracted information and business card images.

Deploy the Streamlit application to a hosting platform or share it with users, allowing them to access and utilize the application for uploading business card images, extracting information, and managing the data.
